Introduction
============
Boids, as an artificial life simulation originally developed by Craig Reynolds, aims to simulate the behaviour of a group of birds. This project is to simulate the movement of two groups of birds by coding with openframework.

The core elements of boids are separation, cohesion and alignment. Separation aims to avoid the collision between birds. Cohesion is to bring birds together to fly. Alignmeent is to give the same fly direction for the whole group.

To avoid the collision between two groups of brids, we need to calculate the distance of two groups when we calculate the separation, cohesion and alignment in each group.

Reflection
==========
As the first project in openframework learning process, this project helps me to get many basic notion in openframework, like the usage of header file and cpp file, and the usage of 'ofVec3f'. i realize that openframework is an amazing framework to make some advanced visual effect. It also fits my study plan very well. I am eager to use openframework to compelte more and more works. I'm soooo appreciate to have a chance to learn it in CCI.
